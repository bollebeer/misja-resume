  description: >
   Marlink is a company that provides mobile services to the maritime sector. The company accumulates huge amounts of data that needs to be analyzed to improve its services. The company needed a Big Data platform to process these volumes of data. One of Marlink's requirements was that the platform should be developed based on PAAS services, preferably with a pay-as-you-go model. My role was to design the platform, set up CI/CD, define development standards for a multidisciplinary team of 5 people, develop ELT for the Boskalis pilot and be responsible for Q&A.
