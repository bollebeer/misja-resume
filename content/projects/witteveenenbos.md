Data engineer at Witteveen en Bos
Witteveen + Bos is an originally Dutch consultancy and engineering firm that provides services in the field of water, infrastructure, the environment and construction. They build a proof-of-concept KPI dashboard using Power BI and SharePoint filled with manually created exports. This solution labor intensive and not performant. They asked for help creating a suitable solution for this use case. We advised a modern cloud data platform using Microsoft Azure and an agile development approach. I was responsible for writing the project plan, creating the initial designs and assisting the solution architect with my technical expertise.
