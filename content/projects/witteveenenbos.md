description: >
  Witteveen + Bos is a consulting and engineering company consisting of many independent business units. To monitor the performance of the business units, the idea of KPI dashboards was developed. A proof-of-concept showed that there was a need to develop a data platform that would allow the creation of KPI dashboards. My role was to design a suitable solution which consisted of a modern data platform using Microsoft Azure. I was responsible for creating the project plan, initial architecture and designs based on the architecture.
