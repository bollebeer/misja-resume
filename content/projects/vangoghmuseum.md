description: >
  VGM wanted to gain insight into the customer behavior of its visitors. This information was stored in various systems. For this, a central data platform had to be developed. I developed the ETL for local systems and APIs, provided and set up Azure environments, trained the staff and was responsible for the implementation of the project.
