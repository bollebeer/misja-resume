description: >
  Clay had a couple of bad performing Databricks jobs that needed improvement. They also wanted to include elastic search into their data platform. Due to allot of changes within the development team there was no consensus on how to build and maintain the solution. As a Data Engineer, I was responsible for: Buidling a component for Elastic Search, Improving the development practices, Improving CI/CD and reworking the bad performing Databricks jobs.
