title: Urgently Migrate a SAS Solution Because of Brexit
date: 2018-02-11T12:41:05-05:00
description: >
  ABN AMRO had a number of applications and systems in the UK that needed to be relocated before Brexit. The following actions needed to be taken: Retire the SAS solution (pension consolidation), migrate the on-premises client server Microsoft Access applications to Azure and migrate the customer portal ABN AMRO to Azure. My task was to design the new cloud architecture in view of the migration, to make agreements with suppliers in connection with the replacement of SAS, to monitor all implementations and to be responsible for the quality of the solution.
