Intergamma is a Dutch franchise-organisation. It owns two hardware store-chains, namely Gamma and Karwei. Intergamma has an outdated BI platform primarily created for static reports. As part of their strategy to become a data driven organization, they want a new data platform that can be used for real-time analytics and data science related use cases. Intergamma had not chosen a preferred cloud and had solutions into the Google Cloud Platform, Azure and Amazon Web Services. The assignment was to help Intergamma decide where and how to build their data platform using scenarios for the three different cloud providers. I was responsible for identifying the requirements by reviewing the different stakeholders, researching the current market offerings and building out the different scenarios.
