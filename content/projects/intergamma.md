# TODO

Intergamma currently has a data platform based on Netezza technology used by a small team of data analysts, mainly for reporting. The current platform hardly meets todays requirements and will not be able to facilitate Intergamma’s ambition on applying data and analytics in the near future.
To ensure wider availability of data products and services, to enable the full potential of modern business intelligence technology and to further scale advanced analytics experiments and solutions, Intergamma is looking for a clear vision on how to develop its data & analytics infrastructure.

Scope:
Advise Intergamma about the to be chosen cloud framework.
Design Intergamma’s future data and analytics platform;
To retrieve better data quality and deeper insights in (Advanced) Analytics.
Advise about Data Lineage, Data quality Monitoring & Access management (Tools & Technology);
To track datasets, their origin, what happens to it, where it moves over time and who has access to it.
Advise about Data Catalog and Data Testing (Tools & Technology);
To Increase data quality and transparency for the entire organization.
Describe how to make data available in a democratic way with good governance.
Deliver an implementation roadmap (Short & Long term) that lists the activities, estimated effort and an advice on when to do what and with which technology.

 Intergamma has an outdated BI platform primarily created for static reports. As part of their strategy to become a data driven organization, they want a new data platform that can be used for real-time analytics and data science related use cases.
  Intergamma had not chosen a preferred cloud and had solutions into the Google Cloud Platform, Azure and Amazon Web Services. The assignment was to help Intergamma decide where and how to build their data platform using scenarios for the three different cloud providers. I was responsible for identifying the requirements by reviewing the different stakeholders, researching the current market offerings and designing out the different scenarios.
