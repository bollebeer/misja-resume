description: >
  Intergamma had a legacy data warehouse and analytics platform based on IBM Netezza. As part of their strategy to become a data-driven company, they needed a modern data platform. I was responsible for formulating the requirements, outlining the different cloud scenarios (AWS, Azure, GCP) and developing a roadmap.
