title: Design and Building a Data Warehouse to Replace Existing Qlik Solution
date: 2018-02-11T12:41:05-05:00
description: >
  Samskip is a transportation company that has grown through numerous acquisitions. Due to the complex and fragmented IT landscape, there was an urgent need to make data centrally available. A data platform was developed and a pilot report was created to demonstrate the value of the platform. I developed ETL from AS400 (DB2) and other on-premises systems, implemented and configured Azure environments, translated logic from QlikView reports into data marts, and trained staff on the use of Data Factory.
