description: >
  Design and implementation of a data platform for the Shared Service Center (SSC), which is part of TBI. The SSC provides IT services to 17 companies in the construction and infrastructure sectors. 
  Given the large number of data sources (hundreds) that needed to be integrated into the data platform, I developed and designed a metadata-driven solution to solve this problem. I set up CI/CD, defined the development standard, trained the client's staff, and migrated the SSIS functionality to Azure Data Factory.
