Data engineer at Stedin
Stedin is a network operator for gas and electricity in South Holland, Utrecht, the Amstelland region, Kennemerland and Northeast Friesland. They had just migrated their on-premises data warehouse (Oracle, Informatica) to a modern big data platform in Azure (Hive, HDInsights, Informatica and SQL Server Managed Instance). After the migration Stedin had difficulty in keeping the platform up and running and asked for an assessment on the current solution. I was responsible for interviewing the stakeholders, identifying the technical and organizational problems, creating a roadmap and presenting the results to the client.
