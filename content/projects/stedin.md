description: >
  Stedin had just migrated his on-premises data warehouse (Oracle, Informatica) to a Big Data platform in Azure with HDInsights, Informatica, and SQL Server Managed Instance. After the migration, Stedin was struggling to keep the platform running. They asked for an assessment of the current solution. I was responsible for interviewing stakeholders, identifying the technical and organizational issues, and creating an improvement plan.
