title: Redesign and Rebuild a Data Platform for Nationale Nederlanden 
date: 2018-02-11T12:41:05-05:00
description: >
 A reusable data platform was created by Nationale Nederlanden. The data platform had to be implemented for one of the business units. Due to the importance of this project, we were commissioned to do so. During the project we realised that the platform was not sufficient for the implementation. The solution was not aligned with our use case and the quality of the components was poor. We advised the client to rebuild the platform with different components. The client followed our advice and as the project progressed, we rebuilt the platform with the following technologies: terrafrom, databricks, synapse, purview, great expectations, data lake gen 2. We also introduced automated infrastructure testing and improved the CI/CD pipelines. The project ended with a successful implementation of the data platform. As a Data Engineer, I was responsible for: designing the infrastructure structure, rebuilding ETL, improving CI/CD, knowledge sharing and realizing the data quality component.
