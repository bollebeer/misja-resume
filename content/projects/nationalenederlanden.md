title: Redesign and Rebuild a Data Platform for Nationale Nederlanden 
date: 2018-02-11T12:41:05-05:00
description: >
 During the implementation of Nationale Nederlanden's reusable data platform for a business unit, it became clear that the data platform did not meet the requirements. The GDD team designed and built a new data platform with: terraform, databricks, synapse, purview, great expectations, data lake gen 2. We also implemented automated infrastructure testing and improved the CI/CD pipelines. The project ended with a successful implementation of the data platform. As a Data Engineer, I was responsible for: designing the infrastructure structure, rebuilding ETL, improving CI/CD, knowledge sharing, and implementing the data quality component.
