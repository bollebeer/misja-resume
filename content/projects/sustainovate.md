description: >
  Sustainovate is a data processing organization for shipping companies. They create data solutions (reports and metrics) that are shared between shipowners, environmental organizations and universities. Their current data platform was not designed to fulfill the new requirements regarding privacy, accountability, and security. I was responsible for identifying the requirements, creating the use cases, designing the technical solution.
