date: 2022-08-10
description: >
 Vattenfall is a Swedish energy and utility company. They have a data warehouse based on Azure using 
 the following services Analysis services, Synapse and Databricks, which was troubled with 
 performance, maintenance, cost problems. I was part of a new scrum team responsible for migrating 
 this data warehouse to a modern Lakehouse architecture based on Databricks and DBT (a database 
 build tool). As a Data Engineer and Solution Architect, I was responsible for: Designing the new 
 architecture, determining the technology stack, set up the infrastructure, setup CI/CD pipelines, 
 training the team into the chosen technologies, extracting the data source using Databricks notebooks 
 (PySpark) and quality assurance.
