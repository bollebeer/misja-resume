  Design of a solution architecture for Croonwolter&dross' new data warehouse. The current situation was an on-premises solution characterized by performance issues and unable to support future advanced analytics applications. Principles for the new data platform: integration of new data sources (including an Acto ERP system and the Acto data warehouse), migration to Azure Cloud, support for streaming data and advanced analytics, halving of ETL process times, manageability by own staff.
