description: >
  Het Nieuwe Instituut has an obligation to the government to report on the progress and budgets of long-term projects. For this they wanted to use a data platform and accompanying reports. I developed the ETL of the local systems (AFAS and Exact), implemented and set up the Azure environment and was responsible for the realization of the entire project.
