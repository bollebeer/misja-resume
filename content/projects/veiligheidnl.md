date: 2018-02-11T12:41:05-05:00
description: >
  VeiligheidNL process data related to traffic incidents for the Dutch government. This data is supplied by hospitals and other medical instances. Due to GDPR regulations they need to filter any data that is not related to traffic incidents. A machine learning model was build in order achieve this. This model was incorporated in a public API where hospitals can upload their information. As a Data Engineer, I was responsible for: Designing the API, Building the API and improving CI/CD.
