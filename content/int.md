Who is Misja?
I am 30 and currently live in Zoetermeer (currently looking for a new place a bit closer to Amsterdam).
I lived for a couple of years in Valencia (Spain) and fell in love with the country and its people.
My original plan was to become a chef but somehow I ended up in IT and I donâ€™t regret it.
Cooking is now my hobby and I love to cook for family, friends and colleagues. 
My other hobbies are motorcycles (I drive a KTM 1190), guitars and DIY projects.
